/*
Your challenge is to create a TypeScript function that
turns an array of key-value pairs into a neatly organized object.
We have a function that seamlessly merges the keys and values from
the array, transforming them into a structured object.

Once your function is crafted, apply it to an array filled
with various key-value pairs. Witness the array's shift
into a tidy and structured object, showcasing its newfound form.
